## Sociospatial distribution of PurpleAir sensors in Maryland

**Project description:** Ensuring accurate and updated air quality information to all Americans should be a public health priority. Particularly with today’s increased manufacturing, wildfires, and transportation, air quality reporting is absolutely necessary.

### The spatial distribution of citizen-science air quality sensors disproportionately affects already marginalized individuals.

By continuing to rely on wide-scale data for reporting, the government is leveling one more public health concern against communities already facing elevated health risks due to class- and race-based discrimination.


### Using [PurpleAir's public data](https://map.purpleair.com/) and USCB tract data, differences were calculated between where someone lives and their closest sensor.

scipy's cKDTree was used to perform a nearest-neighbor analysis between census tracts and PurpleAir sensors.

### Differences were found.
