## Final Project: Colorado River Basin

Given the multiple heart attacks from the recent droughts in southern California, the lessened discharge that makes it down to Mexico, and the political issues about allocating water resources, I decided to delve into some water consumption data to see which counties consumed the most, and what could potentially determine consumption rates. I mainly focused on relationships with water consumption between the variables median household income, percent white, total population, and the size of each county. Using mapping/plotting and analytical techniques learnt during the spring GES 486, analysis was done on domestic water usage in the Colorado River Basin (CRB).


### Here is a map which shows the distribution of water consumption across the counties within the hydrological boundary
