## Final Project: Colorado River Basin

With the multiple heart attacks from the recent droughts in southern California, the lessened discharge that makes it to Mexico, and political issues when it came to allocating water resources, I decided to delve into some water consumption data to see which counties consumed the most, and what could potentially determine consumption rates. I mainly focused on relationships with water consumption between the variables median household income, percent white, total population, and the size of each county. Using mapping/plotting and analytical techniques learnt during the spring GES 486, analysis was done on domestic water usage in the Colorado River Basin (CRB).
