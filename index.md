## About Me
------

As a driven undergraduate student nearing graduation, I am looking for valuable experiences related to my interests that would benefit me post-graduation. My love for water and intrigue of weather drives my interest in both hydrology and geomorphology- particularly extreme floods and the potential impact of climate trends on rainfall intensity and flood frequency. Watershed scale responses to stresses and restoration are also an interest of mine, as well as the severity of storm surge flooding in relation to increased sea level.

My prior experiences ready me for office work and a professional environment, allowing me to be familiar with how to communicate in a professional matter, as well as helping me discover and further cultivate empathy, determination, and persistence. In terms of learned skills, all my internships helped develop familiarity with multiple Office programs, such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

In my free time, I find myself preoccupied with working on home renovation projects, going to the range for some archery, or attempting to be a good father to my two parakeets. 
Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, opportunities, or collaborations.
